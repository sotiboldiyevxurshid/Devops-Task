# Modify the script from the previous exercise. Make the "file_count" function accept a directory
# as an argument. Next have the function display the name of the directory followed by a colon.
# Finally, display the number of files to the screen on the next line. Call the function three times.
# First, on the "/etc" directory, next on the "/var" directory and finally on the "/usr/bin" directory.

# Example output:

# /etc:
